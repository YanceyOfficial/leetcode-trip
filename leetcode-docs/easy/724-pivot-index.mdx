## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the **pivot index** of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers **strictly to the left** of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers **strictly to the right** of the index.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is `0` because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the **leftmost pivot index**. If no such index exists, return `-1`.

:::note Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

:::

:::info Examples

```bash
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11
```

```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
```

```bash
Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + (-1) = 0
```

## Solution

This problem can be efficiently solved using the **prefix sum** technique. Instead of calculating left and right sums repeatedly for each index, we can compute them smartly in a single pass.

**Key Insight:**
- For any index `i`, if `leftSum` is the sum of all elements to its left, and `total` is the sum of all elements in the array, then:
  - `rightSum = total - leftSum - nums[i]`
- We want to find where `leftSum === rightSum`

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the array
2. Initialize `leftSum = 0`
3. Iterate through the array:
   - Calculate `rightSum = total - leftSum - nums[i]`
   - If `leftSum === rightSum`, return the current index `i`
   - Update `leftSum` by adding `nums[i]`
4. If no pivot index is found, return `-1`

**Example walkthrough:**

For `nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]`, total = 28:

```
i=0: leftSum=0, rightSum=28-0-1=27, 0≠27, leftSum becomes 1
i=1: leftSum=1, rightSum=28-1-7=20, 1≠20, leftSum becomes 8
i=2: leftSum=8, rightSum=28-8-3=17, 8≠17, leftSum becomes 11
i=3: leftSum=11, rightSum=28-11-6=11, 11===11 ✓ return 3
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - one pass to calculate total sum, one pass to find pivot
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - only using constant extra space

```ts
function pivotIndex(nums: number[]): number {
  const len = nums.length
  const sum = nums.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val)
  let leftSum = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (sum - nums[i] - leftSum === leftSum) {
      return i
    }
    leftSum += nums[i]
  }

  return -1
}
```
