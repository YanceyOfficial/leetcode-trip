## Problem

Given an `m x n` matrix, return `true` if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return `false`.

A matrix is **Toeplitz** if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

:::note Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 20`
- `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 99`

:::

:::info Examples

```bash
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is true.
```

```bash
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```

## Solution

Iterate through each element in the matrix (starting from the second row and second column) and compare it with its top-left neighbor. If the matrix is Toeplitz, every element must equal its top-left neighbor along the same diagonal.

This approach requires only a single pass through the matrix to determine if it's a Toeplitz matrix.

**Time Complexity**: O(m × n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns.
**Space Complexity**: O(1), using only constant extra space.

```ts
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isToeplitzMatrix = function (matrix) {
  const m = matrix.length
  const n = matrix[0].length

  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (matrix[i][j] !== matrix[i - 1][j - 1]) {
        return false
      }
    }
  }

  return true
}
```
